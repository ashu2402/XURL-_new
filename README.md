XURL is a utility that can be used to generate and retrieve short URLs when we donâ€™t want to use the original longer URLs.

During the course of this project,
1. Created a short url library with required methods.
2. Implemented register method to take a long URL and return a shorter URL.
   -> Web server can generate a random unique short url if requested.
   -> Also user can pass a custom short url as per his requirement (which must be unique i.e. no such short url must exist in the database)
3. Implemented a method to lookup the long URL by providing the short URL.
4. Implemented hit count to track number of long URL lookups.
5. A method which deals with the expiration and removal of urls not used for quite some time.
6. Tested this implementation with test cases.
